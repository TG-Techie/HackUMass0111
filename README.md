# ACP's HackUMass VII Project

ACP stands for **A**bstract **C**oding **P**un (or **A**CP  **C**oding **P**un).

The discovery of [efficient quantum algorithms for integer factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm) has jeapordized the security of modern public-key cryptographic systems like RSA. Though [lattice-based cryptographic systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography) have been proposed to bypass attack by quantum computers, it remains unknown whether or not an efficient algorithm for solving computational lattice problems exists. In fact, the only cryptographic system that has been mathematically proven to be perfectly secure is the [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad). With this in mind, ACP has built a messaging application for iOS and Android with perfectly secure one-time pad encryption. Oppressive regimes around the world, including China, Russia, and the DPRK, have taken great effort to restrict the freedom of the individual to keep his private information secure. ACP's one-time pad application is a powerful step towards freedom and away from authoritarianism and [the companies that perpetuate it](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-china-censorship-apps-flag/).
